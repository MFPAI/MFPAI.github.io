# {{page.title}}

Dear Melbourne::Compose community,

The COVID-19 pandemic has made it impossible for us Melbourne::Compose
organisers to plan ahead in a responsible manner. Therefore, we're suspending
Melbourne::Compose 2020 Conference until further notice.

We held the first Compose 2020 meeting back in November 2019, when we set
a calendar and some guidelines on how to improve on the feedback that you gave
to our 2019 survey, and had already drawn up a preliminary budget. During
February 2020 we had agreed on a date, requested the reservation for the venue,
pre-invited guest speakers (pending on venue confirmation), started talks with
the local FP meetups for a closer collaboration, and more.

All this preparation is not for nothing: at some point in the future we'll be
able to pick up where we left it. We'll continue working on sharing the
practice and craft of Functional Programming.

Compose organisers are also thinking of ways we can project our energies during
the coming months of enforced social distancing. We also invite you, our
community, to get in touch with us and let us know you're there. Please follow
[@composemelb](https://twitter.com/composemelb) on Twitter for updates.

In these difficult times for many communities, we urge you to please take care of yourselves, and to think of others as well. Social distance is a medical necessity, but we're also going to need a lot of interpersonal closeness if we're going to get through the year.

Thanks to all of you for being part of Melbourne::Compose. We could have never
done it without you. When we start again, we'll only be able to do it because
of you.

With kindness and hope,

Javier Candeira
