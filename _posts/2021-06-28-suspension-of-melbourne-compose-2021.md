# {{page.title}}

Dear Melbourne :: Compose community,

The MFPAI/Compose organisation wishes you the best of health, and a
good life-work balance. It's been a tough year and a half for many,
and we hope you got off as lightly as can be expected.

There was no Melbourne::Compose 2020, and we're afraid we can't find a
way to make a 2021 edition happen either. The problem with uncertainty
is that you can't measure its speed and its location at the same time,
even using purely functional tools.

We look forward to returning to normality, which for us will mean
putting up conferences again. We don't know when that will be, and
we'll make sure to let all of you know as soon as we figure it out.

Please follow [@composemelb](https://twitter.com/composemelb) on Twitter for updates.

Thanks to all of you for being part of Melbourne::Compose, especially
the ones who got in touch to ask about this year's conference. It's good
to know that our work doesn't go unnoticed, and we're in people's minds.
You're in our minds too.

Please take care of yourselves and, if you have some
strength to spare, maybe look after each other as well.

<br>
With kindness and hope,

MFPAI and Melbourne::Compose Organisers
