# {{page.title}}

As 2020 lands, we're pleased to announce that we have added four new members to our association:

* Anna Rolland
* Brendan Zabarauskas
* Javier Candeira
* Maun Suang Boey

We're very thankful for their participation and are all looking forward to
collaborating together in the coming year.

This year we're planning to expand the scope of our activities. Our expanded membership
should help revitalise MFPAI as well as provide some redundancy in terms of both
capabilities and presence.
